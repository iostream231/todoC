# todoC
A Task manager to enforce you to do your chores (for UNIX) with RayLib.

# Features
ummmm.... if you don't do all ur tasks by 21 it will close ur session.

# Usage
I wonder why anyone will want to use this, but if you want:
just move all executables in ./executables to ur binaries folder (like /usr/local/bin). And then set todo_reminder to start automatically next time you login (this depends on your window manager).
